# JustDoIt — Roadmap

Feature backlog and upcoming work. Items are roughly ordered by priority within each section.

---

## Planned

### Chat with your notes (RAG / semantic search)
Natural-language Q&A grounded in the user's own notes, with citations. Embed notes into a `pgvector` column (Supabase supports the extension), keep embeddings fresh on note save (online-only side effect, like version snapshots), and add an Edge Function that does vector retrieval + an Anthropic completion — the evolution of the existing "smart search" AI action. Same embedding index unlocks **related-notes suggestions** and smarter `[[ ]]` auto-linking.

---

### Public note sharing (read-only links)
Share a single note via a tokenized public URL. Reuses the ICS-feed pattern almost exactly: a per-note revocable token (on `notes` or a small `note_shares` table) and a `verify_jwt = false` Edge Function (or public route) that renders the note read-only. Settings/editor UI to enable, copy, and revoke the link. No new infra.

---

### Presence on shared notes
Realtime "who's viewing" avatars on workspace notes (live cursors as a follow-up). Built on Supabase Realtime **presence**, complementing the comments + mentions collaboration layer already shipped.

---

### Offline sync: reconcile server-side deletes
`pullAll` is incremental (only fetches rows with `updated_at` newer than the last pull) and merges them into the cache, so it never notices rows that were **hard-deleted** on the server — those linger in the local cache until a sign-out/clear. Soft-deletes (`deleted_at`) sync fine; the gap is hard deletes (e.g. a DB reset, or another device permanently removing a row). Options: a periodic full reconciliation pass that diffs cached ids against the server set and prunes the difference, or a tombstone/deletions feed. Cross-account leakage is already handled (the cache is wiped when the signed-in user changes); this is the same-user deletion case.

---

## Considering

### Mobile App
A React Native app sharing auth and data with the same Supabase backend. The API is already fully in place, and offline mode (see Completed) is done — a key prerequisite for a good mobile experience.

---

### Saved views / smart filters
Save a query (e.g. "tasks due this week tagged #work") as a reusable sidebar item. Builds on the existing search.

---

### Timeline / Gantt view
A project-planning view of tasks with due dates, alongside the existing list/board/calendar views.

---

### Task dependencies
"Blocked by" relationships between tasks, beyond parent/sub-task nesting, for real project workflows.

---

### Personal API tokens + webhooks
Generalize the feed-token pattern into scoped personal access tokens, plus outbound webhooks on events (note/task created, mention, etc.) to enable Zapier/n8n/automation. Pairs naturally with self-hosting.

---

### Two-way calendar sync
The heavier follow-up to the one-way ICS feed: full Google/Outlook sync via provider OAuth + change webhooks.

---

### Account backup & restore
Complement the existing export with a full re-import, making account migration and disaster recovery real. A good self-hosting companion.

---

### Public-endpoint hardening
Rate limiting + error tracking (e.g. Sentry) on unauthenticated endpoints (`calendar-feed`, future public shares / API). Pairs with the admin dashboard.

---

### End-to-end encryption for notes
A privacy tier where note content is encrypted client-side, strongly complementing self-hosting. (Trades off server-side search/AI — needs design.)

---

## Completed

### Frontend Features
- [x] **Mentions in Workspaces** — `@`-mention workspace members in note content (autocomplete against accepted members, mirroring the `[[ ]]` note-link picker). On save (online-only side effect), newly-mentioned members get a row in the new `mentions` table — unique on `(source_id, mentioned_user)` so re-editing never re-notifies — and a best-effort Web Push via the existing `push-send` function. A notifications **bell** in the TopBar shows the unread count, lists recent mentions, marks them read, and updates live via a Supabase Realtime subscription. RLS: recipients (and the author) can read, only workspace members can create, only recipients can mark read/dismiss. Covered by `scripts/test-mentions.ts` (`npm run test:mentions`). (Task-title mentions reuse the same `mentions` table and are a small follow-up.)
- [x] **Admin Dashboard (app-operator)** — operator-facing `/admin` route with aggregate metrics across all users (user count + new-in-7-days, notes total/trash, tasks total/completed, workspaces total/active, recent sign-ups). Introduces a **global admin role**: an `is_admin` flag on `profiles`, distinct from workspace roles, granted out-of-band. A `before update` trigger (`protect_is_admin`) prevents end-user sessions from self-escalating the flag (migrations/seed/Studio/service-role pass through). The `admin-stats` Edge Function verifies the caller's `is_admin` and runs the aggregate queries with the service-role key (RLS-bypassing) server-side — the key never reaches the browser. The route is gated server-side (non-admins get 404) and the Admin nav link only renders for admins. Covered by `scripts/test-admin.ts` (`npm run test:admin`)
- [x] **ICS Calendar Feed** — read-only, one-way calendar subscription so users can see their due-dated tasks and notes in Google/Apple/Outlook. The `calendar-feed` Edge Function (`verify_jwt = false`) generates an `.ics` feed authenticated by a per-user, revocable token stored at `profiles.settings.calendar_feed_token` (calendar clients poll unattended, so token-in-URL rather than JWT); it looks the user up by token with the service-role key and emits VEVENTs for tasks (all-day or floating-local timed) and notes (UTC), with RFC 5545 escaping + line folding. Indexed token lookup (`profiles_calendar_feed_token_idx`). Settings → "Calendar feed" section to enable, copy, regenerate, and disable the subscription URL. No two-way sync. Covered by `scripts/test-calendar.ts` (`npm run test:calendar`)
- [x] **Desktop App (Tauri)** — native desktop client in `desktop/`: a Tauri v2 shell that loads the hosted web app in a system webview (the app is server-rendered — RSC, `proxy.ts` middleware, OAuth callback route — so a static bundle isn't viable; offline still works via the web app's own PWA service worker). The loaded URL resolves from `JUSTDOIT_APP_URL` (runtime → compile-time → `localhost:3000` dev default) in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`. Cross-platform installers (macOS/Windows/Linux) are produced by the `.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml` GitHub Actions release workflow (tag `desktop-v*`), since macOS/Windows builds require their own runners. Unsigned for now (code-signing secrets to be added later). Complements the already-installable PWA with a richer native window
- [x] **Comments on Shared Notes** — discussion threads on workspace notes. New `note_comments` table (`id`, `note_id`, `user_id`, `content`, `created_at`, `updated_at`) with RLS gated on accepted workspace membership of the note's workspace (reusing `is_workspace_member`); authors can edit/delete their own comments. Collapsible Comments panel at the bottom of the NoteEditor, shown only for workspace notes, with a composer (⌘/Ctrl+Enter to post) and inline edit/delete. Live updates via a Supabase Realtime `postgres_changes` subscription on `note_comments` (the first client-side `.channel()` usage). Online-only; degrades to a notice when offline. Covered by integration tests in `scripts/test-milestone8.ts`
- [x] **Offline Mode** — local-first data layer for notes, tasks and lists. IndexedDB cache via Dexie (`src/lib/offline/`); service worker caches the app shell (network-first navigations with `/offline` fallback, stale-while-revalidate assets) so the app loads offline. Optimistic writes go through a repository that updates the cache and queues an outbox op; a FIFO flush worker (retry/backoff, stops on first failure to preserve order) replays them when online. Last-write-wins conflict resolution on `updated_at`; recurring-task completion ported client-side to match the server RPC. Sync-status menu in the TopBar (Connected / Syncing / N pending / Offline / error) with manual "Sync now" and "Retry failed"; cache cleared on sign-out. Tag editing, AI, attachments, search, workspaces and export remain online-only. Pure logic covered by unit tests (`npm run test:offline`)
- [x] **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — installable on desktop and mobile via `app/manifest.ts` (name, icons, standalone display, brand `theme_color`); generated icon set (192/512/maskable/apple-touch/notification badge) in `public/`; service worker registered app-wide via `ServiceWorkerRegister` with a minimal `fetch` handler so the app qualifies as installable (offline caching to be layered on for Offline Mode)
- [x] **Kanban board view** — toggle between list and board view in any task list; drag cards between To Do / In Progress / Done columns via `@dnd-kit`; status synced to DB; assignee avatar and priority badge on cards
- [x] **Note version history** — throttled snapshots saved to `note_versions` table; History panel in the note editor with version list, diff preview, and one-click restore
- [x] **Task assignment in workspaces** — `assigned_to` column on `tasks`; workspace member picker in the task detail panel; "Assigned to me" filter toggle in the task list header; status picker (To Do / In Progress / Done) in task detail
- [x] **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** — TOTP-based 2FA via Supabase Auth MFA (`enrollMFA` / `challengeMFA`); enrollment UI with QR code in Settings → Two-factor authentication; `mfa-challenge` screen in the login flow
- [x] **Note Graph View** — `/graph` route with D3.js force-directed canvas showing `[[Title]]` note connections; zoom/pan/drag; node tooltips; click to open note; linked-only or show-all toggle
- [x] **Attachment uploads in notes** — "📎 Attach" button in the format bar uploads files/images to the `note-attachments` Supabase Storage bucket; inserts a Markdown image or link at cursor position
- [x] **Bulk actions on notes** — "Select" mode in the notes grid adds checkboxes; action bar with Archive and Trash buttons for the selected items
- [x] **Bulk actions on tasks** — "Select" mode in the task list adds checkboxes; action bar with Complete and Delete buttons
- [x] **Print view** — `@media print` CSS hides sidebar, topbar, and editor toolbar via `data-role` / `data-print` attributes; notes render cleanly when printed or saved as PDF
- [x] **Focus mode** — toggle button (expand icon) in NoteEditor toolbar and `F` key shortcut; hides sidebar and topbar via `html[data-focus="true"]` CSS; `Esc` to exit
- [x] **Syntax highlighting in preview** — `marked-highlight` + `highlight.js` (github-dark theme) in the Markdown preview; fenced code blocks get language-aware colours
- [x] **Keyboard shortcuts reference** — `?` key anywhere in the app opens a modal listing all shortcuts; `Esc` to close
- [x] **AI features** — `supabase/functions/ai` Edge Function proxying to Anthropic (`claude-haiku-4-5`) with 4 actions: summarize note, suggest tags, generate task list, smart search (natural language query); AI buttons in NoteEditor format bar; smart search toggle in search results; requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` Supabase secret
- [x] **Shared workspace improvements** — role management UI (owners can promote/demote/remove members), role badges (owner/admin/member), recent activity feed per workspace
- [x] **Due dates on notes** — `due_at` column on `notes`, date-time picker in NoteEditor toolbar with clear button and relative label; notes appear on the Calendar
- [x] **Calendar enhancements** — Month/Week view toggle; notes with due dates shown as diamond dots alongside task dots; drag-and-drop to reschedule tasks and notes onto different days (updates DB on drop)
- [x] **Custom note templates** — "Save as template" in the format bar stores any note's content to `profiles.settings.templates`; template modal shows "My templates" section with per-template delete, alongside 6 built-in templates
- [x] **Backlinks index** — collapsible "Backlinks" panel at the bottom of each note showing all notes that link to it via `[[Title]]`; powered by `ilike` content search, no extra migration needed
- [x] **Drag-and-drop reorder** — tasks within a list (grip handle + dnd-kit), lists in the sidebar, notes in the grid; all persisted via Supabase RPCs (`reorder_tasks`, `reorder_todo_lists`, `reorder_notes`)
- [x] **Export enhancements** — download individual notes as `.md` from the editor; export a list as Markdown or CSV; import notes from `.md` / `.txt` / `.json` files
- [x] Next.js 16 frontend with full auth flow (email/password, OAuth)
- [x] **GitHub and Google OAuth** — "Continue with GitHub / Google" buttons are fully implemented in `AuthCard.tsx`; activate by creating OAuth apps in the GitHub/Google developer consoles and pasting the credentials into Supabase dashboard → Authentication → Providers (steps in `CLOUD_SETUP.md`)

### Backend & Infrastructure
- [x] **Self-Hosting** — run JustDoIt with no managed-cloud dependency (see [`SELF_HOSTING.md`](SELF_HOSTING.md)). Frontend ships as a Next.js **standalone** Docker image (`web/Dockerfile`, `output: 'standalone'`) brought up by `self-hosting/docker-compose.yml` alongside the official `supabase/docker` backend. Background jobs keep **full parity** on self-hosted Trigger.dev (`auth-hook` now reads a configurable `TRIGGER_API_URL`, defaulting to the cloud). Email is transport-agnostic: a shared `trigger/lib/email.ts` sends via **SMTP** (nodemailer) when `SMTP_HOST` is set, else Resend, else degrades — so the whole stack can run cloud-free. Known caveat: `workspace-invite` emails still use Resend (invite works in-app without it). Not yet validated end-to-end in a production cluster
- [x] Supabase backend: auth, notes, tasks, tags, reminders, recurring tasks, workspaces, RLS
- [x] Edge Functions: `dashboard`, `search`, `export`, `reminder-webhook`, `reminder-cancel`, `workspace-invite`, `push-subscribe`, `push-send`
- [x] Trigger.dev background jobs: reminders, recurring tasks, daily digest, export ZIP
- [x] Real-time sync via Supabase Realtime WebSocket
- [x] Supabase Storage for note attachments and exports
- [x] `push_subscriptions` table with RLS for browser push notification delivery
